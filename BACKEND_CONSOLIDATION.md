# Backend Consolidation

This document outlines the changes made to consolidate the backend strategy for PropCloud.io.

## Overview

The codebase previously had a mix of Supabase and Firebase services, which created confusion and inconsistency. We've standardized on Supabase for all backend services, including authentication, database, and storage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Supabase Service Layer

Created a comprehensive service layer for all core entities:

- `PropertyService`: CRUD operations for properties
- `BookingService`: Booking management
- `TaskService`: Task management
- `CommunicationService`: Message handling
- `WaitlistService`: Waitlist management
- `ProfileService`: User profile management

### 2. Database Schema

Created a complete database schema with proper relationships and row-level security:

- `properties`: Property listings
- `bookings`: Booking information
- `tasks`: Property-related tasks
- `messages`: Communication messages
- `waitlist`: Waitlist entries
- `profiles`: User profile information

### 3. Authentication

Standardized on Supabase Auth for user authentication:

- Login/signup functionality
- Session management
- Protected routes

### 4. React Hooks

Created React hooks for interacting with the Supabase services:

- `useProperties`: Property management
- `useBookings`: Booking management
- `useProfile`: User profile management

### 5. Waitlist Integration

Updated the waitlist functionality to use the Supabase service:

- Form submission directly to Supabase
- Database trigger for email notifications

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All backend interactions now follow the same pattern
2. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for all entities
3. **Security**: Row-level security ensures data privacy
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Scalability**: Supabase provides a scalable infrastructure

## Next Steps

1. Implement OTA integration architecture
2. Connect AI services to real data in Supabase
3. Enhance user profile management
4. Add comprehensive testing

## Migration Guide

For any components still using Firebase services, update them to use the equivalent Supabase services:

- Replace `import { ... } from '@/lib/firebase/services/...';` with `import { ... } from '@/lib/supabase/services';`
- Update any Firebase-specific code to use the Supabase equivalent
- Test thoroughly to ensure functionality is maintained
